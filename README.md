# DSA-Labtask-5-SinglyLinkedList_WithSearch
This Python program implements a singly linked list with basic operations: insertion at the beginning and end, displaying the list, and searching for a value. It uses a Node class for list elements and a LinkedList class to manage operations. The search() method traverses the list to find and report the target value.
